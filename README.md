Hexsoftware Python intership
This repository contains my internship tasks.

## Description
Task 1: 
Project 1. Infinite Fibonacci series
The Fibonacci series is a sequence where each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers.
Project 2. Voice assistant
Build a voice assistant to personalize and automate tasks according to your needs.
Project 3. Game of Tic-Tac-Toe
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid, one with Xs and the other with Os. A player wins when they mark all three spaces of a row, column, or diagonal of the grid, whereupon they traditionally draw a line through those three marks to indicate the win. It is a solved game, with a forced draw assuming best play from both players.
